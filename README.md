# Webdevelopment Course

Clone this repository. You'll be able to see the output from the browser development session: Output.

Note: for JavaScript content: JavaScript/js/main2.js  I recommend you to execute each block of code individually. Once it became a single block for notes, possibly it fail if you attempt to load it in a single shot.

Thanks.
